🎮 Space Invaders – Group Project

Buckinghamshire New University
Module: COM4008 – Programming Concepts
Academic Year: 2025–26

👥 Team Members & Responsibilities
Name	Requirement	Contribution
Jahanzab Hassan	Requirement 1 – Invader System	Implemented all enemy types, movement, shooting & difficulty increase
Alex	Requirement 2 – Player System	Built player movement, continuous bullets, collision, and life/respawn system
Sheral	Requirement 3 – Barrier System	Created destructible green barriers that take damage from enemies & player
🧩 Project Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Space Invaders game.
Each team member completed one of the required core mechanics, which were then integrated into a single working game.

The final game includes:

Player movement & shooting

Three types of invaders

Random enemy firing

Progressive difficulty

Four destructible barriers

Collision and scoring

Game over and win conditions

🚀 Features Implemented
✅ Requirement 1 — Invader System (by Jahanzab Hassan)

I implemented:

3 different types of aliens

Side-to-side swarm movement

Random invader bullet firing

Speed increase as invaders are destroyed

Collision with player bullets

Full invader array formation

Programming Concepts Used:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), lists/arrays, movement patterns, randomization, collision detection, game loops.

🎮 Requirement 2 — Player System (by Alex)

Alex implemented:

Player movement (left & right)

Continuous bullet shooting

Player bullet collision with enemies

3-life system with respawn

Detection when the player gets hit

Game over logic

Concepts Used:
Event handling, state management, object classes, projectile logic, keyboard input.

🛡️ Requirement 3 — Barrier System (by Sheral)

Sheral implemented:

Four green barriers placed above the player

Barriers break when hit by player or enemy bullets

Smooth destruction using tile/block breakdown

Proper rendering to show damaged sections

Concepts Used:
2D arrays, graphics rendering, object interaction, damage systems.

▶️ How to Run the Game
If using Python + PyGame:
pip install pygame
python main.py

If using Dart + Flutter:
flutter pub get
flutter run


(Modify based on your actual setup.)

🧪 Testing & Integration

Throughout development, our team:

Made regular commits to GitHub

Tested each requirement independently

Merged all systems into one working game

Communicated issues using GitHub Issues
Our Space Invaders recreation successfully demonstrates:

Object-oriented programming

Logical game loops

Collision detection

Team collaboration

Version control

Real gameplay mechanics

All three requirements were completed and integrated into a working final project.
Ensured invaders, player, and barriers interact correctly

This helped us maintain clean, trackable progress while working as a team.
